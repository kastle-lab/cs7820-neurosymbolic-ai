# CS 7820: Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence

## Motivation

Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims to build rich
computational AI models, systems and applications by combining neural
and symbolic learning, representation, and reasoning through combining
the complementary strengths of neural and symbolic AI while overcoming
their respective weaknesses. This may be accomplished through their
principled integration of their representations or by developing hybrid
systems that combine neural and symbolic components in a single
architecture.\[1\]

## Required Background

Students are expected to have some facility in Knowledge Graphs (i.e.,
symbolic representation and reasoning) or in Deep Learning (i.e., neural
learning and representation). Ideally, students will have competencies
in both.

## Course Learning Objectives
Students attending this course will be exposed to:
* the state of the art in Knowledge Graphs (e.g., semantic technologies)
* the state of the art in Deep Learning (e.g., LLMs)
* the state of the art in their fusion (i.e., Neurosymbolic AI), such as
knowledge graph embeddings, link prediction, and entity classification.

## Course Learning Outcomes
Students that successfully complete this course, will have:
* reviewed knowledge graphs and deep learning topics at the cutting edge
of the state of the art
* practiced reading, reviewing, and discussing scientific literature and
research articles
* implemented a neurosymbolic architecture

## Method of Instruction
The course will be held in-person.
* In-person attendance is strongly encouraged. There will be no recordings
or streamed lectures. All seminar discussions will occur in person and
synchronously, unless otherwise noted in the course schedule or on
Pilot.
* The implementation project will be a group project by default.

## Evaluation
The course will be evaluated across three categories.
* Homework Assignments: \(15\%\)
* Seminar Participation: \(45\%\)
* Project Deliverables: \(40\%\)

## Grading Scale
The course will be graded against the following scale

|   |        |
| :-: | :----: |
| A | 100-90 |
| B | 89-80  |
| C | 79-70  |
| D | 69-60  |
| F |  59-0  |

Extra credit is available at the instructor’s discretion. Requests for
extra credit will not be entertained. There is no guaranteed curve on
any deliverable or grade.

## Course Content Outline

| **Week \#** | **Content**                |
| :---------: | :------------------------- |
|      1      | Review: Knowledge Graphs   |
|      2      | Review: Deep Learning      |
|      3      | Overview: Neurosymbolic AI |
|    4-10     | Seminar Discussions        |
|    11-14    | Implementation             |
|     15      | Presentations              |

## Academic Integrity

Discussion of course content with other students can be very useful to
for learning, and it is encouraged. However, it is expected that any
work you turn in will be completed on a purely individual basis.
Students may discuss general concepts with one another, but may not,
under any circumstances, work together on the actual implementation of
any course assignment or the creation of report(s) turned into the
instructor. Also, it should go without saying that quizzes and the final
exam should represent your individual effort. A good rule of thumb is
this: If you’re having a discussion on basic concepts and your shared
understanding of those concepts, you’re fine. If you’re actually writing
report text and/or code in the presence of and with direct contribution
from another person you’re not fine. If you are including text and/or
code written by a third party (with the exception of specific support
libraries approved by the instructor), you are definitely NOT fine. If
you have ANY questions about what constitutes allowable collaboration or
code library use, please contact the instructor for clarification. He
will be happy to help you determine if your use of a specific library or
package is acceptable or if your intended collaboration with another
student crosses any ethical lines. In addition to the above policies
related to collaboration stated in this syllabus, students are expected
to at all times comply with the Wright State University Code of Student
Conduct and in particular the portions pertaining to Academic Integrity.

## Student Resources

Students with a disability that require special accommodations to fully
participate in this course are encouraged to contact the WSU Office of
Disability Services (<http://www.wright.edu/disability-services>). The
course instructor will work enthusiastically with that office to ensure
that appropriate accommodations are made to ensure full access to
materials and assessment instruments.
